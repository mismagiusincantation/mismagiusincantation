<p align="center"> i've noticed a few people recently have been using discord to host their images and are wondering why they keep disappearing; it's because discord has ceased support for file hosting outside of their platform. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking">hotlinking</a> in general is very unreliable, but here are two websites that can be used for hosting files if needed: </p>
<p align="center">
<a href="https://catbox.moe">catbox.moe</a> for permanent file hosting.
</p>
<p align="center">
<a href="https://litterbox.catbox.moe">litterbox.catbox.moe</a> for temporary file hosting.
</p>
<p align="center">
these are just a few suggestions, you can find alternatives if you'd prefer to use another service, just stop using discord to host images please and thank you!
